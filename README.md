# React + FastAPI

This is a template for a simple TODO list coupling React and FastAPI. Inspired by the tutorial on [TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-react/)

## Getting started

If you have docker, simply use the following command:

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Then stop the container with `docker-compose down`. Don't forget to prune your containers once it's done.
